  <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    This Legal Disclaimer applies to the ECHO Pentest website and any information provided through it.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>1. No General Advice</h3>
    <p>
      The content on this website is provided for general information purposes only.
      It is not intended to be professional advice (legal, security, technical or otherwise)
      for any specific situation or organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should not rely solely on the information on this site when making decisions about

  <div class="card">
    <h3>2. No Guarantee of Security</h3>
    <p>
      Penetration testing and security assessments can significantly reduce risk and help identify weaknesses,
      but no test can guarantee that systems are completely secure or that future vulnerabilities will not arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Threats, technologies and environments change over time. Reports and recommendations reflect the state of
      systems at the time of testing and based on the agreed scope and assumptions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>3. Scope & Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      Any conclusions or findings described in reports, proposals or communications are based on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The systems, applications and environments included in the agreed scope</li>
      <li>The time period in which testing was performed</li>
      <li>The access, information and permissions provided</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Areas not included in scope, or changes made after testing, may introduce new risks that are not covered.
    </p>
