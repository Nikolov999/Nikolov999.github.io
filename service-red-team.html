  <h2>Scenario-Based & Red Team Style Engagements</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes you need more than a checklist-style assessment. Scenario-based and red team style
    engagements focus on realistic goals and attack paths to test how well your people, processes,
    and technology work together.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>What This Service Focuses On</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Goal-oriented testing (e.g. access to a specific system or data set).</li>
      <li>Chaining multiple weaknesses into realistic attack paths.</li>
      <li>Measuring detection, response, and communication between teams.</li>
      <li>Highlighting strengths as well as gaps in your defenses.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How the Engagement Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We define scope, goals, constraints, and safety rules in detail.</li>
      <li>Testing is carried out carefully to avoid disruption to business operations.</li>
      <li>Evidence is captured at each stage to show what was done and why.</li>
      <li>Findings are presented as narratives and attack paths, not just a list of issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Outcomes You Can Expect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear view of how an attacker could realistically progress in your environment.</li>
      <li>Insight into which alerts fired, which didn’t, and how they were handled.</li>
      <li>Recommendations that combine technical fixes with process improvements.</li>
      <li>Material you can use to train both security staff and leadership.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Is This Right for You?</h3>
    <p>
      This service is best for organizations that already have some security maturity
      and want to test how everything works under pressure, instead of only checking
      isolated systems.
