  <h2>Portfolio & Security Projects</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to hands-on pentesting work, I build tools and concepts that use automation and AI
    to help organizations stay ahead of phishing campaigns and infrastructure weaknesses.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>AI Phishing Analyzer</h3>
    <p>
      An AI-driven phishing analysis concept designed to plug into supported email accounts (for example via secure
      integrations such as OAuth with business-approved mail providers).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once connected — and only for accounts you own or are authorized to monitor — incoming email is continuously
      scanned for phishing indicators such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Suspicious URLs and lookalike domains</li>
      <li>Language patterns typical of social engineering</li>
      <li>Unexpected attachment types and formats</li>
      <li>Sender anomalies compared to normal communication patterns</li>
      <li>Scanning URL's for suspicious, hidden and malicious domains</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal is to flag risky messages early, reduce the chance of a successful phishing attack, and provide
      explainable alerts that help users learn what to watch out for.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>AI Vulnerability Analyzer</h3>
    <p>
      A concept tool focused on quickly assessing exposed services for systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
      The idea is simple: you provide a target IP address within an approved scope, and the analyzer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifies open ports and running services on the target</li>
      <li>Attempts to determine service versions where possible</li>
      <li>Compares discovered versions against known public vulnerabilities (CVEs)</li>
      <li>Surfaces potential issues with context so they can be triaged and validated</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This kind of tool is meant to support responsible, authorized vulnerability management — not random or
      unauthorized scanning of systems.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Automation & Reporting Scripts</h3>
    <p>
      Lightweight scripts to help during engagements with tasks such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recon data collection and organization</li>
      <li>Parsing scan results into human-readable summaries</li>
      <li>Generating sections of reports from structured findings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal is to spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time on analysis and clear communication.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Hands-On Labs & CTF Work</h3>
    <p>
      Ongoing practice in lab and capture-the-flag environments to stay sharp on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web exploitation and API abuse scenarios</li>
      <li>Privilege escalation on different operating systems</li>
      <li>Lateral movement and post-exploitation techniques</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This practical experience feeds directly into the way I approach real-world assessments.
