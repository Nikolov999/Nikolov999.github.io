  <h2>Reporting & Remediation Support</h2>
  <p>
    A good assessment doesn’t end with a scan output. The real value comes from
    clear communication and practical guidance that your teams can act on.
    This service underpins every engagement I deliver.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>What My Reporting Includes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Executive summary:</strong> what was tested, key risks, and business impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical findings:</strong> detailed descriptions, evidence, and affected assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk ratings:</strong> severity and priority to help you focus effort.</li>
      <li><strong>Remediation guidance:</strong> practical steps and references for fixing issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Remediation & Follow-Up Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Walkthrough sessions for technical teams to discuss complex findings.</li>
      <li>Clarification on recommendations and potential implementation approaches.</li>
      <li>Re-testing of fixed issues where agreed.</li>
      <li>Input into longer-term security roadmaps and future testing cycles.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Many organizations already know they have issues somewhere. The value of a pentest
      is turning that uncertainty into a prioritized, understandable plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to leave you with more than a PDF — you should walk away with a clear
      sense of what to do next, who needs to be involved, and how to measure progress.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Ready to Turn Findings Into Actions?</h3>
    <p>
      Whether you’re planning your first assessment or building an ongoing testing program,
      I can help you go from “we had a pentest” to “we actually improved our security”.
