      <p>
        Every organization is different. Some need a focused test of a single application, others want a deeper look
        at their network or people. Below is a quick overview and a simple “scope helper” to point you toward the
        service that usually fits best.
      </p>

      <!-- Simple scope wizard -->

        <h3>Not sure where to start?</h3>
        <p>Pick the option that sounds closest to what you’re worried about:</p>

          <h3>Web Application Pentest</h3>
          <p>
            Comprehensive testing of web apps using techniques inspired by the OWASP Testing Guide. I look for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Broken authentication and session handling</li>
            <li>Access control failures between roles and tenants</li>
            <li>Input validation and injection flaws</li>
            <li>Insecure file upload &amp; data exposure issues</li>
            <li>Business logic abuse that automated scanners often miss</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You receive a report mapped to risk, with clear examples, impact, and remediation steps your developers can action.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Typical range:</strong> €350 – €900 for small sites, €900 – €1,800 for larger or more complex applications.</p>

          <h3>API Security Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            APIs are often the real backbone of modern apps — and a favorite target.
            I assess your APIs for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Broken object-level and function-level authorization</li>
            <li>Insecure authentication and token handling</li>
            <li>Overly permissive responses and data leakage</li>
            <li>Rate limiting, brute force, and enumeration weaknesses</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Typical range:</strong> €450 – €1,200 depending on the number of endpoints and authentication complexity.</p>

          <h3>Network &amp; Infrastructure Testing</h3>
          <p>
            I simulate how an attacker would explore your network and services, within a clearly defined scope.
            This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Host and service discovery within the agreed ranges</li>
            <li>Service misconfigurations and default credentials</li>
            <li>Unnecessary exposure of services and management interfaces</li>
            <li>Opportunities for lateral movement after an initial foothold</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Typical range:</strong> €500 – €1,500 depending on the number of hosts and internal vs. external scope.</p>

          <p>
            Technical controls can be strong, but people are always in the loop.
            I run controlled, authorized social engineering and phishing simulations to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Measure how staff respond to realistic phishing attempts</li>
            <li>Identify gaps in training and internal processes</li>
            <li>Provide feedback that improves awareness without blame</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Typical range:</strong> €250 – €750 for phishing simulations, €750 – €1,400 for multi-step social engineering scenarios.</p>

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Focus on real business objectives (e.g. accessing a specific system or data)</li>
            <li>Chain multiple weaknesses together to show true impact</li>
            <li>Help you test detection, incident response, and playbooks</li>

            <li>A clear, prioritized report for technical and non-technical audiences</li>
            <li>Walkthroughs of critical findings and attack paths</li>
            <li>Remediation guidance and optional follow-up to verify fixes</li>

        These ongoing security care plans are designed for small and mid-size businesses that want a realistic,
        affordable way to stay ahead of new vulnerabilities without hiring a full internal security team.

      <h2>Security in Numbers</h2>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is no longer a “big company only” problem. Automated tools constantly scan the internet, looking for
        any system that’s exposed or misconfigured — regardless of your size or industry.

            Almost every internet-facing service is regularly scanned and probed by automated bots looking for known
            weaknesses and outdated software.

            Many real-world breaches start with a simple human mistake — a weak password, a reused credential,
