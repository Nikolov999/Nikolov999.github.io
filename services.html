  <h2>Professional Pentesting Services</h2>
  <p>
    I provide scoped, ethical penetration testing tailored to your environment, your risks, and your business goals.
    The objective is simple: find and explain real-world weaknesses before attackers do — and give you a clear path to fixing them.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Web Application Pentest</h3>
    <p>
      Comprehensive testing of web apps using techniques inspired by the OWASP Testing Guide. I look for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Broken authentication and session handling</li>
      <li>Access control failures between roles and tenants</li>
      <li>Input validation and injection flaws</li>
      <li>Insecure file upload & data exposure issues</li>
      <li>Business logic abuse that automated scanners often miss</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You receive a report mapped to risk, with clear examples, impact, and remediation steps your developers can action.
    </p>

    <h3>API Security Assessment</h3>
    <p>
      APIs are often the real backbone of modern apps — and a favorite target.
      I assess your APIs for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Broken object-level and function-level authorization</li>
      <li>Insecure authentication and token handling</li>
      <li>Overly permissive responses and data leakage</li>
      <li>Rate limiting, brute force, and enumeration weaknesses</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Network & Infrastructure Testing</h3>
    <p>
      I simulate how an attacker would explore your network and services, within a clearly defined scope.
      This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Host and service discovery within the agreed ranges</li>
      <li>Service misconfigurations and default credentials</li>
      <li>Unnecessary exposure of services and management interfaces</li>
      <li>Opportunities for lateral movement after an initial foothold</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Social Engineering & Awareness Testing</h3>
    <p>
      Technical controls can be strong, but people are always in the loop.
      I can run controlled, authorized social engineering and phishing simulations to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Measure how staff respond to realistic phishing attempts</li>
      <li>Identify gaps in training and internal processes</li>
      <li>Provide feedback that improves awareness without blame</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top:10px;">

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Red Team-Style & Scenario-Based Engagements</h3>
    <p>
      For organizations that want to go further, I design scenario-based engagements that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on real business objectives (e.g. accessing a specific system or data)</li>
      <li>Chain multiple weaknesses together to show true impact</li>
      <li>Help you test detection, incident response, and playbooks</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top:10px;">

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Reporting, Debriefs & Ongoing Support</h3>
    <p>
      Every engagement ends with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A clear, prioritized report for technical and non-technical audiences</li>
      <li>Walkthroughs of critical findings and attack paths</li>
      <li>Remediation guidance and optional follow-up to verify fixes</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Security in Numbers</h2>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity is no longer a “big company only” problem. Automated tools constantly scan the internet, looking for
    any system that’s exposed or misconfigured — regardless of your size or industry.
  </p>

  <div class="stats-grid">
    <div class="card stat">
      <div class="stat-title">Constant probing</div>
      <p class="stat-text">
        Almost every internet-facing service is regularly scanned and probed by automated bots looking for known
        weaknesses and outdated software.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card stat">
      <div class="stat-title">Human error is common</div>
      <p class="stat-text">
        Many real-world breaches start with a simple human mistake — a weak password, a reused credential,
        or a phishing email that slipped through.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card stat">
      <div class="stat-title">Attackers reuse old bugs</div>
      <p class="stat-text">
        Public vulnerabilities (CVEs) are quickly weaponized. Unpatched systems remain attractive targets
        long after a fix is released.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card stat">
      <div class="stat-title">Pentesting changes the odds</div>
      <p class="stat-text">
        By proactively testing your defenses, you shift from reacting to incidents to preventing them — with a
        clear list of what to fix first.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The goal of my services is to translate this reality into a practical roadmap: where you’re strong, where you’re weak,
    and how to improve before an incident forces the issue.
