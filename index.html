  <p>I help businesses identify and fix security weaknesses before attackers can exploit them — through real-world, ethical hacking engagements.</p>

  <h2>Why Pentesting Matters for Modern Businesses</h2>
  <p>
    A single security incident can cause data breaches, downtime, financial loss, legal issues, and long-term damage to your brand.
    Attackers only need to find one forgotten misconfiguration or unpatched system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Penetration testing flips that advantage. By simulating realistic attacks in a controlled and authorized way, I help you discover
    how exposed your applications, network, and people really are.
  </p>
  <p>
    The outcome is a clear, prioritized report: what’s vulnerable, how it can be abused, and exactly what steps your team can take
    to reduce risk. Pentesting is not just a compliance checkbox — it’s a core part of a serious security strategy.

    <p>
      Your external and internal networks are constantly being scanned — not just by you, but by automated bots and potential attackers.
      This service focuses on understanding exactly what is exposed, how it can be abused, and what to lock down first.
    </p>
    <p>
      I map out the attack surface within the agreed scope, identify open services, look for weak configurations and outdated software,
      and highlight realistic attack paths an intruder could try to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end result is a prioritized list of changes that make it significantly harder for an attacker to move from
      “I see your system” to “I control your system”.
