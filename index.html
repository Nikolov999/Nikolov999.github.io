  <h1>Professional Penetration Testing & Cybersecurity Services</h1>
  <p>I help businesses identify and fix security weaknesses before attackers can exploit them — through real-world, ethical hacking engagements.</p>

  <h2>Why Pentesting Matters for Modern Businesses</h2>
  <p>
    A single security incident can cause data breaches, downtime, financial loss, legal issues, and long-term damage to your brand.
    Attackers only need to find one forgotten misconfiguration or unpatched system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Penetration testing flips that advantage. By simulating realistic attacks in a controlled and authorized way, I help you discover
    how exposed your applications, network, and people really are.
  </p>
  <p>
    The outcome is a clear, prioritized report: what’s vulnerable, how it can be abused, and exactly what steps your team can take
    to reduce risk. Pentesting is not just a compliance checkbox — it’s a core part of a serious security strategy.

  <div class="card featured-service">
    <div class="featured-label">Most requested</div>
    <div class="featured-title">Network & Infrastructure Testing</div>
    <p>
      Your external and internal networks are constantly being scanned — not just by you, but by automated bots and potential attackers.
      This service focuses on understanding exactly what is exposed, how it can be abused, and what to lock down first.
    </p>
    <p>
      I map out the attack surface within the agreed scope, identify open services, look for weak configurations and outdated software,
      and highlight realistic attack paths an intruder could try to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end result is a prioritized list of changes that make it significantly harder for an attacker to move from
      “I see your system” to “I control your system”.

<!-- 🧑‍💻 ABOUT ME SECTION -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>🧑‍💻 About Me & How I Work</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>From Labs to Realistic Attack & Defense Scenarios</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t just read about security — I actively build and break things in controlled environments.
      I’ve completed full end-to-end pentest scenarios, including realistic attack paths, privilege escalation, and
      lateral movement, as well as defensive analysis scenarios where the focus is on understanding what happened
      and how to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve also worked through malware analysis scenarios, focusing on how malicious tooling behaves,
      how it installs persistence, and what artifacts it leaves behind for defenders to detect.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>AI-Driven Security Tools I’ve Built</h3>
    <p>
      To push things further, I work on using AI and automation to support security teams:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Phishing Analyzer</strong> — A concept designed to integrate with authorized mail accounts and
        continuously scan incoming email for phishing indicators such as suspicious links, sender anomalies,
        and social engineering patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Vulnerability Analyzer</strong> — A tool idea focused on authorized targets: given an IP address within
        scope, it discovers open services and versions, then compares them against known public vulnerabilities (CVEs)
        to surface potential issues faster.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These projects aren’t about replacing humans — they’re about giving defenders and testers better visibility
      and faster triage so they can focus on the highest risks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Certifications & Continuous Learning</h3>
    <p>
      I back up my hands-on work with structured learning and certifications, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)</li>
      <li>GRCP(Governence, Risk and Compliance Professional)</li>
      <li>CCSK(Cloud Cyber Security Knowledge)</li>
      <li>CISCO Verified Offensive Security Ethical Hacker</li>
      <li>Fortinet Cybersecurity Associate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These represent different angles on offensive security, governance, cloud, and defensive thinking — all of which
      feed into the way I plan and execute assessments.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why I Do This & How It Connects to My Services</h3>
    <p>
      My motivation is simple: I like understanding how things break, but I care even more about helping people fix them.
      Every lab, scenario, and tool I work on is about turning complex security problems into clear, understandable actions
      for real businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is the front door for that work. Whether you’re looking for a focused test of a single application
      or a broader look at your network and processes, my goal is to bring the same mix of curiosity, discipline,
      and clear communication to your engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re ready to see where you stand — and what you can improve before an attacker forces the issue —
