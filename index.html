        <h1>Pentesting that keeps your clients, insurers & auditors off your back.</h1>
        <p>
          I run scoped, legal penetration tests for small and mid-size businesses in Ireland so you can
          prove you take security seriously — to clients, regulators and insurers — before an attacker
          forces the issue.
        </p>

        <ul class="hero-bullets">
          <li>Real-world offensive testing across web apps, APIs, networks and people.</li>

        <h3>Most booked: Network & Infrastructure Pentest</h3>
        <p>
          For companies that want to know exactly what their internet-facing systems expose, and how far
          an attacker could realistically push if they got a foothold.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scoped external and internal testing in agreed ranges</li>
          <li>Discovery of exposed services, weak configs and default setups</li>
          <li>Identification of outdated and vulnerable software</li>
          <li>Remediation roadmap prioritized by business impact</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:0.5rem; font-size:0.9rem;">
          Typical range: from single-site checks for small teams to multi-host reviews for growing businesses.

    <h2>Not sure if you’re “secure enough” yet?</h2>
    <p>
      Start with a simple self-check. The free 2025 Small Business Cybersecurity Checklist helps you see,
      in one page, whether you’re probably fine for now — or whether you should seriously consider a
      pentest in the next 3–6 months.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0.75rem; font-size:0.9rem; max-width:640px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
      You can use it internally, or bring it to a call with me and we’ll turn the answers into a scoped,
      fixed-price engagement.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Who I’m a good fit for</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I’m most useful when you’re big enough that security actually matters — but not big enough to have
        a full-time security team.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>5–200 person companies based in Ireland or serving Irish customers.</li>
        <li>At least one internet-facing app, client portal, booking system or internal VPN.</li>
        <li>Clients, partners, insurers or auditors asking “how do you handle security?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top:0.5rem; font-size:0.9rem;">
        If that sounds like you, you don’t need a 12-person red team. You need one person who will go
        deep, document everything, and actually help you close the gaps.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- CORE SERVICES -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Core Services</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Web Application Pentesting</h3>
      <p>
        For anything your customers or staff log into — client portals, booking systems, small SaaS tools,
        admin panels.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look for broken access control, injection, session issues and business logic flaws that automated
        scanners consistently miss.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
        Typical outcome: a clear list of exploitable issues, proof of impact, and concrete changes your
        developers can action without guesswork.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Network & Infrastructure Testing</h3>
      <p>
        External and internal testing to answer one simple question: “If someone targets us, what can they
        realistically do from the outside, and what happens if they get in?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I map exposed services, weak configurations, legacy systems and lateral movement paths, then
        prioritize which ones you should tackle first.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Social Engineering & Phishing Simulations</h3>
      <p>
        People are still the easiest way in. I run controlled, authorized phishing and awareness campaigns
        so you can measure human risk without shaming anyone.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
        You get statistics, anonymized examples, and concrete training themes instead of vague “users need
        more awareness” slides.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Security Consultation & Reporting</h3>
      <p>
        The value of a pentest is in what you do afterwards. Your deliverables are built to be read by both
        technical teams and decision makers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Executive summary in plain language for management and clients.</li>
        <li>Technical findings with evidence, impact and remediation steps.</li>
        <li>Optional follow-up sessions to walk through fixes and retest changes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- LIGHT PRICING / EXPECTATIONS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What does a typical engagement cost?</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I don’t publish a rigid price list because scope, complexity and risk appetite differ. But you should
        have a rough idea of the ballpark before you reach out.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Smaller single-site or focused web app tests often start around <strong>€350–€900</strong>.</li>
        <li>More complex apps, APIs or network scopes typically fall in the <strong>€900–€2,000+</strong> range.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top:0.5rem; font-size:0.9rem;">
        You’ll always receive a fixed-price quote and written scope of work before anything starts. No
        surprise bills, no hourly burn.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0.25rem; font-size:0.9rem;">
        For exact numbers, the fastest path is a short call:
        <a href="book-a-pentest.html">book a discovery call</a> and we’ll scope it properly.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW A TYPICAL PENTEST ENGAGEMENT WORKS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What working together actually looks like</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <ol style="padding-left:1.2rem;">
        <li><strong>Short discovery call</strong> — 20–30 minutes to understand your environment, drivers and deadlines.</li>
        <li><strong>Written proposal</strong> — clear scope, methods, timelines and fixed pricing. You can share it with internal stakeholders or clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal & logistics</strong> — Scope of Work, Rules of Engagement and Authorization to Test are signed by an authorized party.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing window</strong> — agreed dates and intensity; I keep you informed about any high-impact findings as they surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Report & debrief</strong> — you get a full report plus an optional call to walk through findings and next steps.</li>
      </ol>
      <p style="margin-top:0.5rem; font-size:0.9rem;">
        The goal is simple: no black-box mystery, no drama — just a realistic view of your risk and a path
        to reduce it.

  <!-- ABOUT ME SECTION -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Why trust me with breaking your systems on purpose?</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>From home lab work to realistic attack & defense scenarios</h3>
      <p>
        I don’t treat pentesting as a checklist exercise. I run full attack chains in labs: gaining an initial
        foothold, escalating privileges, moving laterally and mapping out complete kill chains — then
        switching hats and analysing how it all shows up in logs and monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve also worked through malware and post-exploitation tooling, focusing on how it persists,
        how it evades basic controls, and which artifacts defenders can realistically rely on.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem;">
        That background means your test isn’t just “nmap + scanner + PDF”. It’s modeled on how real
        attacks unfold.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>AI-assisted tools I’ve built to support security work</h3>
      <p>
        To go beyond manual checks, I build my own tools and automations to speed up analysis and
        surface the highest-risk areas first:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Phishing Analyzer</strong> — integrates with authorized mail accounts to classify and
          explain suspicious emails, helping teams understand why something is risky.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Vulnerability Analyzer</strong> — combines service discovery with public CVEs to spotlight
          the most dangerous exposures, not just the longest list.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
        These aren’t gimmicks. They help me spend more time validating impact and less time copying
        and pasting scanner output.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Certifications & structured learning</h3>
      <p>
        I back up practical work with structured paths and external validation, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)</li>
        <li>GRCP (Governance, Risk and Compliance Professional)</li>
        <li>CCSK (Cloud Certified Security Knowledge)</li>
        <li>CISCO Verified Offensive Security Ethical Hacker</li>
        <li>Fortinet Cybersecurity Associate</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
        These don’t replace results, but they show I’m invested in both offensive techniques and the
        governance/compliance world your business actually operates in.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Why I do this</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve always been more interested in how systems fail than how they’re supposed to work. Pentesting
        is the clean version of that obsession: break things in a controlled, legal way so you can fix them
        before someone else breaks them for real.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.4rem;">
        If you want a rubber-stamped checkbox report, I’m not your guy. If you want someone to really try
        to get in — and then help you close those doors — that’s where I fit.
