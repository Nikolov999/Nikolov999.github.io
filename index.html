  <p>I help businesses identify and fix security weaknesses before attackers can exploit them — through real-world, ethical hacking engagements.</p>

  <h2>Why Pentesting Matters for Modern Businesses</h2>
  <p>
    A single security incident can cause data breaches, downtime, financial loss, legal issues, and long-term damage to your brand.
    Attackers only need to find one forgotten misconfiguration or unpatched system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Penetration testing flips that advantage. By simulating realistic attacks in a controlled and authorized way, I help you discover
    how exposed your applications, network, and people really are.
  </p>
  <p>
    The outcome is a clear, prioritized report: what’s vulnerable, how it can be abused, and exactly what steps your team can take
    to reduce risk. Pentesting is not just a compliance checkbox — it’s a core part of a serious security strategy.
