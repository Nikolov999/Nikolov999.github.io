<!-- ABOUT ME SECTION -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>About Me & How I Work</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>From Labs to Realistic Attack & Defense Scenarios</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t just read about security — I actively build and break things in controlled environments.
      I’ve completed full end-to-end pentest scenarios, including realistic attack paths, privilege escalation, and
      lateral movement, as well as defensive analysis scenarios where the focus is on understanding what happened
      and how to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve also worked through malware analysis scenarios, focusing on how malicious tooling behaves,
      how it installs persistence, and what artifacts it leaves behind for defenders to detect.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>AI-Driven Security Tools I’ve Built</h3>
    <p>
      To push things further, I work on using AI and automation to support security teams:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Phishing Analyzer</strong> — A concept designed to integrate with authorized mail accounts and
        continuously scan incoming email for phishing indicators such as suspicious links, sender anomalies,
        and social engineering patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Vulnerability Analyzer</strong> — A tool idea focused on authorized targets: given an IP address within
        scope, it discovers open services and versions, then compares them against known public vulnerabilities (CVEs)
        to surface potential issues faster.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These projects aren’t about replacing humans — they’re about giving defenders and testers better visibility
      and faster triage so they can focus on the highest risks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Certifications & Continuous Learning</h3>
    <p>
      I back up my hands-on work with structured learning and certifications, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)</li>
      <li>GRCP(Governence, Risk and Compliance Professional)</li>
      <li>CCSK(Cloud Cyber Security Knowledge)</li>
      <li>CISCO Verified Offensive Security Ethical Hacker</li>
      <li>Fortinet Cybersecurity Associate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These represent different angles on offensive security, governance, cloud, and defensive thinking — all of which
      feed into the way I plan and execute assessments.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why I Do This & How It Connects to My Services</h3>
    <p>
      My motivation is simple: I like understanding how things break, but I care even more about helping people fix them.
      Every lab, scenario, and tool I work on is about turning complex security problems into clear, understandable actions
      for real businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is the front door for that work. Whether you’re looking for a focused test of a single application
      or a broader look at your network and processes, my goal is to bring the same mix of curiosity, discipline,
      and clear communication to your engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re ready to see where you stand — and what you can improve before an attacker forces the issue —
      feel free to reach out through the contact page and we can plan a scoped, ethical pentest that fits your environment.
