  <h2>Network & Infrastructure Penetration Testing</h2>
  <p>
    Your network is the backbone of everything your organization does. At the same time, it’s constantly
    being scanned, probed, and mapped by automated tools and potential attackers. This engagement is about
    understanding exactly what you expose — and how an attacker could realistically move through it.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>What This Service Focuses On</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>External attack surface: internet-facing hosts, services, and management interfaces.</li>
      <li>Internal network exposures: shares, weak segmentation, and unnecessary trust relationships.</li>
      <li>Service misconfigurations and default or weak credentials.</li>
      <li>Outdated software versions with known vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Potential attack paths an intruder could chain together.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Typical Engagement Flow</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scoping:</strong> agree on IP ranges, environments, and testing windows.</li>
      <li><strong>Recon & Mapping:</strong> discovery of live hosts, open ports, and exposed services.</li>
      <li><strong>Vulnerability & Configuration Review:</strong> identification of risky services and weak controls.</li>
      <li><strong>Exploitation Attempts (where appropriate):</strong> carefully controlled attempts to validate impact.</li>
      <li><strong>Reporting & Debrief:</strong> clear breakdown of what was found and what to fix first.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>What You Get Out of It</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A prioritized list of internet-facing and internal exposures.</li>
      <li>Evidence showing how those exposures could be abused in practice.</li>
      <li>Concrete hardening recommendations (e.g. firewall rules, segmentation, config changes).</li>
      <li>Input you can feed into patching, monitoring, and long-term security strategy.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>When This Service Is a Good Fit</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You’re unsure what’s actually exposed to the internet right now.</li>
      <li>You’ve gone through growth or infrastructure changes without a recent security review.</li>
      <li>You want a practical view of how far an attacker could get from a single exposed entry point.</li>
    </ul>
