  <h2>Sections in More Detail</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
      A concise overview for leadership and non-technical stakeholders.
      It explains what was tested, the overall risk posture, and the most important improvements to focus on,
      without going into low-level technical details.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Scope & Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      This section sets out what was in scope (and what was not), how testing was performed, and any constraints
      or assumptions that are important for interpreting the results. It helps ensure that the report can be
      understood months or years later.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Risk Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Before diving into individual findings, the report highlights overall patterns — for example,
      recurring access control issues, unpatched software, or weak credential hygiene.
      Risk ratings and a summary table make it easier to see where to focus first.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Technical Findings</h3>
    <p>
      Each finding typically includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Title and short description</li>
      <li>Risk rating and affected assets</li>
      <li>Impact and potential business consequences</li>
      <li>Evidence (screenshots, requests/responses, reproduction steps)</li>
      <li>Remediation guidance and references where relevant</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Remediation & Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of the report, the most important actions are grouped and prioritised.
      Where a formal retest is planned, the report can also include a proposed retest scope
      so you know what will be re-verified once fixes are in place.
